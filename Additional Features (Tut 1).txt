Yes (with Julian)


Maybe

- Task can be set to self-destruct (hidden) after a certain deadline
- Regular expression search
- Task can be set to remain hidden until certain date
- Extract task info from email 
- Group task based on location of task (for delivery/estate agent?)
- Compute optimal task completion order (shortest distance) if location of tasks are different
- Encrypt specific (only show first few letter) or all tasks (confidential/sensitive info)
- Mute software (no alarm/reminder) --- maybe automute if keyboard inactive for x min/full screen app

- Window auto resize to show al tasks x days to deadline
- Voice recognition for setting / off alarms
- Tasks can be set to auto perform an OS operation
- Auto-completion using dictionary
- Encryption of tasks
- Attach files (img/video/documents) to tasks
- Location-based reminder/alarm
- Auto-correction
- Search for empty slots for task
- Be able to set recurring task
- GUI
- User can use a keyboard shortcut to call the program


~GUI-specific
- Option to sort by date, time and or priority
- Display only tasks x days from deadline
- Modify/add task with GUI

~Internect required
- Assign task to someone
- Collaborate on tasks




Unlikely

- Stylus/touch support (for GUI)
- Location-based alarm/reminder (requires GPS/internet)
- Store statistics (avg time taken to complete task, avg number of task/day during different months, 
  highest num of tasks in a day etc) for user's self analysis
- Handwritten text recognition â€“ if user uses tablet (if we can find a free and reliable software to integrate into our app)
